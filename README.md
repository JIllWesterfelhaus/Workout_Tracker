# Workout_Tracker

This is an assignment for Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp.  It consists of a workout tracker.

## Motivation

As a user, I want to be able to view, create and track daily workouts.  I want to be able to log multiple exercises on a given day.  I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is cardio, I should be able to track my distance traveled. 

## Build Status
